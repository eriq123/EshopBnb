## Eshop Beauty N' Bottles

An inventory system version 2 using:

-   Laravel
-   Vue
-   Vuetify
-   Axios

Strength:
This version provides a better user experience than the previous one as the use of vue handles all http request using axios makes the need for reloading every request unnecessary.

Weakness:
Although each page lessen the need to reload an entire page, this version is not a single page application since i would need more time to analyze and plan the use of an SPA authentication. At the time of this writing, the developer is having a hard time deciding which package to use and would like to know the features of the mentioned package before including them in the implementation.

Opportunities:
Vue state management package like VueX is an interesting opportunity to do in the future as it would reduce the repetitions of code (i.e. snackbar).

Vision:
Transforming this system into a single page application is one of the possibility the developer is looking forward. It would however put a question as to whether using laravel as backend or the use of vue-cli to create another version would be better.

**Enjoy!!**
